\section*{Problem: Representation of directed weighted graph-edges}
display numbers -> adds a lot of clutter
\\\\
create a hierarchy of different arrows, representing a handful of differently weighted edges -> cannot find good looking design using only one arrow property, when multiple properties are modulated the hierarchy becomes unclear
\\\\
scale thickness of arrows -> hard to gauge whose arrows value is higher in comparison, also ugly
\\\\
position small fuel/energy icon aside arrows -> adds some clutter, hard to position neatly
\\\\
only display numbers, when hovering over arrows -> users need to think forward to solve the levels and having to hover over arrows all the time is tedious
\\\\
Replace edges with linear paths of arrows, with the number of arrows equaling the weight of the edge -> creates hard layout problems, adds a lot of clutter
\\\\
Place big stars or planets along arrows, with their number equaling the edge weight (indicating stops on the journey) -> hard to distinguish stars from background stars, users have to tediously count stars, stars may be distracting clutter
\\\\
Add crossections to the arrow, like on a ruler -> doesnt look good, spacing of crosssections becomes inconsistent (feels weird)
\\\\
Add flowing animation from source to destination (speed, number of flyers) -> edgeweights should be discernible from a still image, speed is hard to gauge

\section*{Problem: UI-Design Learnings}
Everything a user needs needs to know has to be readily visible  \\\\
UI-Sprite Borders have to be slim to look nice \\\\
UI should be clear even in a still image

\section*{Problem: Learnings from Alpha-Testing}
Multiple Choice Fragebogen?

\section*{Problem: The Joys of Phaser}
Containers cannot be nested -> as such a lot of the ui-hierarchy had to be flattened and be built less modular (couldnt leverage relative positioning and property-inheritance as much) \\\\
Bitmapmasks produced weird darkened areas in areas with alpha of the masked sprite -> needed to convert all bitmapmasks to geometrymasks \\\\
rexUI a plugin developed for UI was time-consuming to use (searching docs all the time) and didnt offer enough flexibility to design original UI elements (Clipping mask of ScrollablePanel was forcably set to a rectangle ???) \\\\
tweens were a delight to use (are very powerful)

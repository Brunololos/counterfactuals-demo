\section*{Problem: Representation of directed weighted graph-edges}
display numbers -> adds a lot of clutter
create a hierarchy of different arrows, representing a handful of differently weighted
\\\\
edges -> cannot find good looking design using only one arrow property, when multiple properties are modulated the hierarchy becomes unclear
\\\\
scale thickness of arrows -> hard to gauge whose arrows value is higher in comparison, also ugly
\\\\
position small fuel/energy icon aside arrows -> adds a lot of clutter
\\\\
only display numbers, when hovering over arrows -> users need to think forward to solve the levels and having to hover over arrows all the time is tedious
\\\\
Replace edges with linear paths of arrows, with the number of arrows equaling the weight of the edge -> creates hard layout problems, adds a lot of clutter
\\\\
Place big stars or planets along arrows, with their number equaling the edge weight (indicating stops on the journey) -> hard to distinguish stars from background stars, users have to tediously count stars, stars may be distracting clutter
\\\\
Add crossections to the arrow, like on a ruler -> doesnt look good, spacing of crosssections becomes inconsistent (feels weird)
\\\\

\section*{Problem: UI-Design Learnings}
Everything a user needs needs to know has to be readily visible  \\\\
UI-Sprite Borders have to be slim to look nice

\section*{Problem: Learnings from Alpha-Testing}
Multiple Choice Fragebogen?
